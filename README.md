# _Welcome to the Superhero Name Generator repository!_
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, TensorFlow, and Keras to generate unique superhero or supervillain names. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 9,000 names, stored in a text file.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model comprises a collection of 9,000 superhero or supervillain names. This diverse dataset ensures a wide range of name styles, allowing the model to learn patterns and generate new, creative names.

## Model Architecture
The NLP model employed in this project utilizes the powerful TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The architecture primarily consists of a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, which are well-suited for sequence generation tasks like name generation.

The model takes character sequences as input and learns to predict the next character, enabling it to generate names character by character. The training process involves iterative optimization to minimize the loss and enhance the model's ability to generate high-quality, realistic superhero or supervillain names.
